This piece of paper is folded to make the following closed three-dimensional object.
 
 \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]

\coordinate (A) at (0,0);
\coordinate (B) at (1,1);
\coordinate (C) at (2,0);
\coordinate (D) at (1,-1);
\coordinate (E) at (0.5,-0.5);
\coordinate (F) at (1.5,-0.5);
\coordinate (G) at (0.5,0.5);
\coordinate (H) at (1.5,0.5);


\fill[gray!30] (A) -- (B) -- (H) -- (F) -- (D) -- cycle;


\fill[gray!50] (A) -- (E) -- (G) -- (B) -- cycle;

\fill[gray!10] (C) -- (H) -- (F) -- (D) -- cycle;

\draw[thick] (A) -- (B) -- (C) -- (D) -- cycle;
\draw[thick] (A) -- (E) -- (F) -- (D);
\draw[thick] (B) -- (G) -- (H) -- (C);
\draw[thick] (E) -- (G);
\draw[thick] (F) -- (H);

\end{tikzpicture}

The number of folds required to form the above object is:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item $9$
        \item $7$
        \item $11$
        \item $8$
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Four equilateral triangles are used to form a regular closed three-dimensional object by joining along the edges. The angle between any two faces is:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $30^\circ$
        \item $60^\circ$
        \item $45^\circ$
        \item $90^\circ$
    \end{enumerate}
 \item In order to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation $\frac{dy}{dt} = -y$ for $t > 0$, with an initial condition $y(0) = 1$, the following scheme is employed
    \[
    \frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{\Delta t} = -\frac{1}{2} (y_{n+1} + y_n).
    \]
    Here, $\Delta t$ is the time step and $y_n = y(n\Delta t)$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \dots$ This numerical scheme will yield a solution with non-physical oscillations for $\Delta t > h$. The value of $h$ is:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\frac{1}{2}$
        \item $1$
        \item $\frac{3}{2}$
        \item $2$
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The value of the surface integral
    \[
    \iint_S x \, dx \, dy
    \]
    where $S$ is the external surface of the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2$, is:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $0$
        \item $4 \pi R^2$
        \item $\frac{4 \pi}{3} R^3$
        \item $\pi R^3$
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Let $f(z)$ be an analytic function, where $z = x + i y$. If the real part of $f(z)$ is $\cosh x \cos y$, and the imaginary part of $f(z)$ is zero for $y = 0$, then $f(z)$ is:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\cosh x \exp(-i y)$
        \item $\cosh x \exp(i z)$
        \item $\cosh z \cos y$
        \item $\cosh z$
    \end{enumerate}
